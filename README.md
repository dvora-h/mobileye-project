# Mobileye Project

Detecting traffic lights and the distance to them on runtime within
given video using image processing and machine learning

## Part 1:

## Traffic Lights Attention

Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized
high- and low-pass filters


## Part 2:

## TFL Detection

 Generating and training CNN using the products of the previous stage as input, to conclude all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow)


## Part 3:

## Distance Estimation

Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest, involving geometric and linear algebra calculations


## Part 4:

## Integration

Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product
